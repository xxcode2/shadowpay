## 💬 Questions to Ask Privacy Cash Team

If they haven't already provided DMs, ask them:

1. **Features**: "What features would make Privacy Cash integration more valuable?"
2. **Marketing**: "What's the best way to reach Privacy Cash users?"
3. **Community**: "Which communities should we target first?"
4. **Timeline**: "When should we launch?"

## 🚀 The Big Picture

### What ShadowPay Solves
✅ Easy payment links (like Stripe, but private)
✅ Privacy-first (Zero-Knowledge proofs)
✅ Non-custodial (funds never touch us)
✅ Solana-native (low fees, fast)
✅ Privacy Cash powered (best-in-class privacy)

### Why It Matters
- Traditional payment links leak metadata
- Privacy Cash offers perfect privacy
- But Privacy Cash is hard to use
- ShadowPay makes it one-click easy

### Market Size
- Stripe handles $500B+ annually
- 5% for Privacy Cash niche = $25B opportunity
- Even 0.1% = $250M annual revenue potential

### Competition
- No one else doing this (you're first!)
- Huge first-mover advantage
- Privacy Cash team backing
- Solana ecosystem support
